# tool_template_node

This is the template for a generic containerized NodeJS tool following the [Tool Specification](https://tool-spec.github.io/tool-specs/) for reusable research software using Docker.

This template can be used to generate new Github repositories from it.

Please note that this project has nothing to do with Javascript frontend tools/libs and NodeJS is also not used to
build some kind of webproject backend stack. We want to integrate NodeJS into a generic workflow runner to make tools available, 
scientists might be used to from frontend development.
